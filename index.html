    <p>From an early age, I've loved figuring out how things work and what positive use can be<br>
        made of them. This attracted me to the field of Engineering and a choice for Mechanical<br>
        Engineering to design components, systems and processes to solve problems. Much of my career<br>
        has been in oil and gas drilling and measurements, helping a vast array of prospectors optimize<br>
        their hydrocarbon yield. I chose to advance my knowledge and skill set in Mechanical Engineering<br>
        in such areas as Systems Engineering, including Subsea Engineering.</p>


    <p>I love to learn new things, and that is a skill that has always been invaluable, especially in these days.<br>
        Currently I have opted to explore my interest in data processing, analytics and applications, in order to<br>
        blend these skill sets with prior knowledge towards the goal of providing solutions to key technical and<br>
        data analytics challenges in diverse fields and industries. My journey has taken me to the Rice University<br>
        Data Analytics Boot Camp, where I am undertaking special topics in Data Analytics and Visualizations.
    </p>


    <p>I am excited with the team at Rice and am eagerly looking forward to the adventures this will bring.</p>
